# K-Means-Clustering-Visualization-and-Evaluation
This project implements the K-Means clustering algorithm to group unlabeled data into clusters based on their similarity. The code generates synthetic data, visualizes the iterative process of cluster formation, and evaluates the clustering performance using metrics like the Silhouette Score, Davies-Bouldin Index, and Adjusted Rand Index.
